# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

- This website allows for the user to decide between recieving an affirmation and a mantra phrase. By clicking either one of the radio buttons, the website then shows the phrase as a result. Another feature of the website is that there are no repeats in the affirmations or mantras and when there are no more available mantras and affirmations, the user is alerted. Another feature of the website is that the user has the option to remove/delete an affirmation or mantra that they do not like. This removes the disliked mantra/affirmation from the original list and if the user cycles through the whole list and decides that they don't like any, they are alerted that they must refresh the page to start over. 

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

- To get the app cloned down and running, you should start at the github repo link. The user should then fork and clone the repo using `git clone` and then typing the SSH key from the forked github repo. You should then type `cd self-care-center` to move into the root directory. In there, open terminal and type `open index.html` and the website should pop up.

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

- I am currently in Mod1 and I began this project on kickoff day 04/04/23. I finished the first two iterations on that day and then completed the rest of the project by 04/06/23. I worked for about 4 hours a day on the project and I was happy with the progress I was making.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

- The learning goals of this project was to work more with CSS and HTML, while also furthering my knowledge with Javascript functions. I worked mainly with VSCode and Github, while also utilizing resources such as MDN Docs and StackOverflow.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
- I was very happy with how I figured out the functions for the repeating CYOA and how I managed to also refactor them to ensure simplistic functionality. I was also very happy with my CSS and HTML code, successfully formatting them and connecting them to the Javascript functions I wrote for the website. I did face some challeneges with the repeating CYOA and how difficult it was at first, but with proper breaks and also utilizing proper online resources, I managed to work through it.
